== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the size and color of my hover Pin It button? =

This is now available in version 1.0 and higher.

= My image is at least 120x120 and still doesn't have a hover Pin It button! =

The hover Pin It button still might not appear if the following situations are occurring:

* The image is referenced in your CSS or style tags as opposed to an `img src`
* The image is being displayed using a lightbox or other gallery plugin that uses AJAX
* There is some other sort of on-hover effect over the image
* The image has the `data-pin-no-hover="true"` attribute set
* The image has the `nopin="nopin"` attribute set
* Your image `src` starts with `data:`

= The Pin It button is offset when hovering over the image =

This is a known issue that affects the Pin It button on all Wordpress sites when a user is logged in. If you logout, or the user isnâ€™t logged into the site, the Pin It button will appear in the correct spot. This will be fixed soon without any updates to the plugin needed.
